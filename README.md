# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-for-controlling-Computer-Application



Gesture recognition facilitates user-friendly communication between humans and computers and enables the human beings to interact without any mechanical devices such as keyboards, laser pens and many more other devices.

Application of the project is to access an PPT(Power Point) without using a keyboard or a mouse, hand motion detection and sign language understanding using gesture recognition.

This results is enhanced human computer interaction, ease of accessing a computer application and getting rid of difficulties  that exist between the user and computer caused due to any hardware damage or failure such as wear and tear of keyboard, mouse or any I/O device. 

A model is trained using convolution neural network and used to predict gestures.
